# What is KISS and KISS Sorcar? How it started?

During my winter vacation of 2025, I developed KISS, which is a stupidly simple agentic framework.  It took me 18 days to implement KISS. I started with the quest "What is possible (with AI)?" and "What is possible by a 49 year old SWE/PL Professor in 70 days using modern AI?" after teaching the class [Disrupting Systems Research with AI](https://ucbsky.github.io/ucbsky-cs294-264-fall2025/course-website.html) in the Fall of 2025 at UC Berkeley.  Since then KISS has evolved into the IDE **(a free alternative to Cursor or Antigravity)** called **KISS Sorcar** (dedicated to the [Famous Bengali Magician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._C._Sorcar)). It runs locally as a VSCode IDE and in the chatbox you can give any natural language command. The good part is that it is **completely free** and **open-source** with **no monthly subscription fees**.  It **codes really well** and **works pretty fast**.  The agent can **run relentlessly for hours to days**. It is **embedded in a browser** and uses **full-fledged vscode**.  It has **full browser**  and **multimodal** support. I provide support and maintain the framework with long-term commitment.  I do not plan to accept pull requests for the [core](src/kiss/core) and the agents in [assistant](src/kiss/agents/) in the near term.  **Marius Momeu**, my incoming postdoc, will soon join the team.  The project embodies the best software engineering practices that I have learned over the last 30 years.  I will write them up once I get time, but in the meantime, if you are interested, please play with **KISS Sorcar** and see **"what is possible?"**  You will find some sample commands when you run the `curl` command above after setting your `ANTROPIC_API_KEY` (best model for Sorkar), `GEMINI_API_KEY` (required for autocomplete support in KISS Sorcar) in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.  Now I use KISS Sorcar to develop itself.  I am rapidly adding features to KISS Sorcar using KISS Sorcar.  So stay tuned for feature updates regularly including **a safe version of openclaw** added to KISS Sorcar in 2 weeks.

**Now I ask the question to you "what is possible?".**  #whatispossible #KISSSorcar


# Introduction to KISS

## 🎯 The Problem with AI Agent Frameworks Today

The AI agent ecosystem has grown increasingly complex. Many frameworks introduce excessive layers of abstraction and unnecessary techniques, resulting in a steep learning curve that can significantly hinder developer productivity from the outset.

**What if there was another way?**

What if building AI agents could be as straightforward as the name suggests?

Enter **KISS** — the *Keep It Simple, Stupid* Agent Framework.

## 🚀 Your First Agent in 30 Seconds.

Let me show you something beautiful:

```python
from kiss.core.kiss_agent import KISSAgent

def calculate(expression: str) -> str:
    """Evaluate a math expression."""
    return str(eval(expression))

agent = KISSAgent(name="Math Buddy")
result = agent.run(
    model_name="gemini-2.5-flash",
    prompt_template="Calculate: {question}",
    arguments={"question": "What is 15% of 847?"},
    tools=[calculate]
)
print(result)  # 127.05
```

That's a fully functional AI agent that uses tools. No annotations. No boilerplate. No ceremony. Just intent, directly expressed.
Well you might ask "**Why not use LangChain, DSpy, OpenHands, MiniSweAgent, CrewAI, Google ADK, Claude Agent SDK, or some well established agent frameworks?**" Here is my response:

- **KISS comes with KISS Sorcar, a powrful local code IDE that is free and open-source.**
- **KISS comes with [Repo Optimizer](src/kiss/agents/coding_agents/repo_optimizer.py) and [Agent Optimizer](src/kiss/agents/coding_agents/agent_optimizer.py) which enables you to optimize a repository of code (and AI agents) for your metric of choice (e.g., cost and running time or test coverage or code quality/readability).**
- **It has the GEPA prompt optimizer builtin with a simple API.**
- **It has a [RelentlessCodingAgent](src/kiss/agents/coding_agents/relentless_coding_agent.py), which is pretty straightforward in terms of implementation, but it can work for very very long tasks. It was self evolved over time to save cost and running time.**
- **No bloat and simple codebase.**
- **Optimization strategies can be written in plain English.**
- **New techniques will be incorporated to the framework as I research them.**
- **The project effectively applies various programming language and software engineering principles and concepts that I learned since 1995.**

## 🤝 Multi-Agent Orchestration is Function Composition

Here's where KISS really shines — composing multiple agents into systems greater than the sum of their parts.

Since agents are just functions, you orchestrate them with plain Python. Here's a complete **research-to-article pipeline** with three agents:

```python
from kiss.core.kiss_agent import KISSAgent

# Agent 1: Research a topic
researcher = KISSAgent(name="Researcher")
research = researcher.run(
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    prompt_template="List 3 key facts about {topic}. Be concise.",
    arguments={"topic": "Python asyncio"},
    is_agentic=False  # Simple generation, no tools
)

# Agent 2: Write a draft using the research
writer = KISSAgent(name="Writer")
draft = writer.run(
    model_name="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    prompt_template="Write a 2-paragraph intro based on:\n{research}",
    arguments={"research": research},
    is_agentic=False
)

# Agent 3: Polish the draft
editor = KISSAgent(name="Editor")
final = editor.run(
    model_name="gemini-2.5-flash",
    prompt_template="Improve clarity and fix any errors:\n{draft}",
    arguments={"draft": draft},
    is_agentic=False
)

print(final)
```

**That's it.** Each agent can use a different model. Each agent saves its own trajectory. And you compose them with the most powerful orchestration tool ever invented: **regular Python code**.

No special orchestration framework needed. No message buses. No complex state machines. Just Python functions calling Python functions.

## 💬 KISS Sorcar

KISS includes a browser-based IDE, called KISS Sorcar, for writing code and performing general tasks. It provides a rich web IDE which is free, open-source, and runs locally.

```bash
# Launch the assistant (opens browser automatically)
uv run assistant

# Or with a custom working directory
uv run assistant ./my-project

# Or with a specific default model
uv run assistant --model_name "gemini-2.5-pro"
```

The assistant features:

- **Real-time streaming**: See agent thinking, tool calls, and results as they happen
- **Task history**: Previously submitted tasks are saved and available via autocomplete
- **Multimodal input**: Attach images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) and PDFs via upload, drag-and-drop, or paste
- **Modern UI**: Dark theme with collapsible sections for tool calls and thinking

## 🔧 Using Repo Optimizer

**This is one of the most important and useful feature of KISS.** The `RepoOptimizer` (`repo_optimizer.py`) uses the `RelentlessCodingAgent` to optimize code within your own project repository. It runs a specified command, monitors output in real time, fixes errors, and iteratively optimizes for specified metrics — all without changing the agent's interface. The code can be found [here.](src/kiss/agents/coding_agents/repo_optimizer.py).

```bash
# Optimize a program for speed and cost
uv run python -m kiss.agents.coding_agents.repo_optimizer \
    --command "uv run python src/kiss/agents/coding_agents/relentless_coding_agent.py" \
    --metrics "running time and cost" \
    --work-dir .
```

**CLI Options:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--command` | (required) | Command to run and monitor |
| `--metrics` | (required) | Metrics to minimize (e.g., "running time and cost") |
| `--work-dir` | `.` | Working directory for the agent |

**How It Works:**

1. Runs the specified command and monitors output in real time
1. If repeated errors are observed, fixes the code and reruns
1. Once the command succeeds, analyzes output and optimizes the source to minimize the specified metrics
1. Repeats until the metrics are reduced significantly

📖 **For the full story of how the repo optimizer self-optimized the RelentlessCodingAgent, see [BLOG.md](src/kiss/agents/coding_agents/BLOG.md)**

## 🎨 Output Formatting

Unlike other agentic systems, you do not need to specify the output schema for the agent. Just create
a suitable "finish" function with parameters. The parameters could be treated as the top level keys
in a json format.

**Example: Custom Structured Output**

```python
from kiss.core.kiss_agent import KISSAgent

# Define a custom finish function with your desired output structure
def finish(
    sentiment: str,
    confidence: float,
    key_phrases: str,
    summary: str
) -> str:
    """
    Complete the analysis with structured results.
    
    Args:
        sentiment: The overall sentiment ('positive', 'negative', or 'neutral')
        confidence: Confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0
        key_phrases: Comma-separated list of key phrases found in the text
        summary: A brief summary of the analysis
    
    Returns:
        The formatted analysis result
    """
    ...

```

The agent will automatically use your custom `finish` function instead of the default one which returns its argument. The function's parameters define what information the agent must provide, and the docstring helps the LLM understand how to format each field.

## 📊 Trajectory Saving and Visualization

Agent trajectories are automatically saved to the artifacts directory (default: `artifacts/`). Each trajectory includes:

- Complete message history with token usage and budget information appended to each message
- Tool calls and results
- Configuration used
- Timestamps
- Budget and token usage statistics

### Visualizing Trajectories

The framework includes a web-based trajectory visualizer for viewing agent execution histories:

```bash
# Run the visualizer server
uv run python -m kiss.viz_trajectory.server artifacts

# Or with custom host/port
uv run python -m kiss.viz_trajectory.server artifacts --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5050
```

The visualizer provides:

- **Modern UI**: Dark theme with smooth animations
- **Sidebar Navigation**: List of all trajectories sorted by start time
- **Markdown Rendering**: Full markdown support for message content
- **Code Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks
- **Message Display**: Clean, organized view of agent conversations
- **Metadata Display**: Shows agent ID, model, steps, tokens, and budget information

![Trajectory Visualizer](assets/image-0478c494-2550-4bbe-8559-f205a4544bec.png)

📖 **For detailed trajectory visualizer documentation, see [Trajectory Visualizer README](src/kiss/viz_trajectory/README.md)**

## 📦 Developer Installation

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone/download KISS and navigate to the directory
cd kiss

# Create virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.13

# Install all dependencies (full installation)
uv sync

# (Optional) activate the venv for convenience (uv run works without activation)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Set up API keys (optional, for LLM providers)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export TOGETHER_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

### Selective Installation (Dependency Groups)

KISS supports selective installation via dependency groups for minimal footprints:

```bash
# Minimal core only (no model SDKs) - for custom integrations
uv sync --group core

# Core + specific provider support
uv sync --group claude    # Core + Anthropic Claude
uv sync --group openai    # Core + OpenAI Compatible Models
uv sync --group gemini    # Core + Google Gemini

# Assistant agent tools (web tools, browser UI)
uv sync --group assistant

# Docker support (for running agents in isolated containers)
uv sync --group docker

# Development tools (mypy, ruff, pytest, etc.)
uv sync --group dev

# Combine multiple groups as needed
uv sync --group claude --group dev
```

**Dependency Group Contents:**

| Group | Description | Key Packages |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `core` | Minimal core module | pydantic, pydantic-settings, pyyaml, rich |
| `claude` | Core + Anthropic | core + anthropic |
| `openai` | Core + OpenAI | core + openai |
| `gemini` | Core + Google | core + google-genai |
| `assistant` | Agent tools & browser UI | playwright, uvicorn, starlette |
| `docker` | Docker integration | docker |
| `dev` | Development tools | mypy, ruff, pyright, pytest, pytest-cov, mdformat |

> **Optional Dependencies:** All LLM provider SDKs (`openai`, `anthropic`, `google-genai`) are optional. You can import `kiss.core` and `kiss.agents` without installing all of them. When you try to use a model whose SDK is not installed, KISS raises a clear `KISSError` telling you which package to install.

## 📚 KISSAgent API Reference

📖 **For detailed KISSAgent API documentation, see [API.md](API.md)**

## 🎯 Using GEPA for Prompt Optimization

KISS has a fresh implementation of GEPA with some key improvements. GEPA (Genetic-Pareto) is a prompt optimization framework that uses natural language reflection to evolve prompts. It maintains an instance-level Pareto frontier of top-performing prompts and combines complementary lessons through structural merge. It also supports optional batched evaluation via `batched_agent_wrapper`, so you can plug in prompt-merging inference pipelines to process more datapoints per API call. GEPA is based on the paper ["GEPA: Reflective Prompt Evolution Can Outperform Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19457).

📖 **For detailed GEPA documentation, see [GEPA README](src/kiss/agents/gepa/README.md)**

## 🧪 Using KISSEvolve for Algorithm Discovery

This is where I started building an optimizer for agents. Then I switched to [`agent evolver`](src/kiss/agents/create_and_optimize_agent/agent_evolver.py) because `KISSEvolver` was expensive to run. Finally I switched to \[`repo_optimizer`\] for efficiency and simplicity. I am still keeping KISSEvolve around. KISSEvolve is an evolutionary algorithm discovery framework that uses LLM-guided mutation and crossover to evolve code variants. It supports advanced features including island-based evolution, novelty rejection sampling, and multiple parent sampling methods.

For usage examples, API reference, and configuration options, please see the [KISSEvolve README](src/kiss/agents/kiss_evolve/README.md).

📖 **For detailed KISSEvolve documentation, see [KISSEvolve README](src/kiss/agents/kiss_evolve/README.md)**

## 🐳 Docker Manager

KISS provides a `DockerManager` class for managing Docker containers and executing commands inside them. This is useful for running code in isolated environments, testing with specific dependencies, or working with SWE-bench tasks.

### Basic Usage

```python
from kiss.docker import DockerManager

# Create a Docker manager for an Ubuntu container
with DockerManager(image_name="ubuntu", tag="22.04", workdir="/app") as docker:
    # Run commands inside the container
    output = docker.Bash("echo 'Hello from Docker!'", "Print greeting")
    print(output)

    output = docker.Bash("python3 --version", "Check Python version")
    print(output)
```

### Manual Lifecycle Management

```python
from kiss.docker import DockerManager

docker = DockerManager(image_name="python", tag="3.11", workdir="/workspace")
docker.open()  # Pull image and start container

try:
    output = docker.Bash("pip install numpy", "Install numpy")
    output = docker.Bash("python -c 'import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)'", "Check numpy")
    print(output)
finally:
    docker.close()  # Stop and remove container
```

### Port Mapping

```python
from kiss.docker import DockerManager

# Map container port 8080 to host port 8080
with DockerManager(image_name="nginx", ports={80: 8080}) as docker:
    # Start a web server
    docker.Bash("nginx", "Start nginx")
    
    # Get the actual host port (useful when Docker assigns a random port)
    host_port = docker.get_host_port(80)
    print(f"Server available at http://localhost:{host_port}")
```

### Configuration Options

- `image_name`: Docker image name (e.g., 'ubuntu', 'python:3.11')
- `tag`: Image tag/version (default: 'latest')
- `workdir`: Working directory inside the container (default: '/')
- `mount_shared_volume`: Whether to mount a shared volume for file transfer (default: True)
- `ports`: Port mapping from container to host (e.g., `{8080: 8080}`)

The Docker manager automatically handles image pulling, container lifecycle, and cleanup of temporary directories.

## 🏷️ Versioning

The project uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). The version is defined in a single source of truth:

- **Version file**: `src/kiss/_version.py` - Edit this file to update the version
- **Package access**: `kiss.__version__` - Access the version programmatically
- **Build system**: `pyproject.toml` automatically reads the version from `_version.py` using dynamic versioning

Example:

```python
from kiss import __version__
print(f"KISS version: {__version__}")
```

To update the version, simply edit `src/kiss/_version.py`:

```python
__version__ = "0.2.0"  # Update to new version
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

**Embedding Models** (for RAG and semantic search):

Each model in `MODEL_INFO` includes capability flags:

- `is_function_calling_supported`: Whether the model reliably supports tool/function calling
- `is_generation_supported`: Whether the model supports text generation
- `is_embedding_supported`: Whether the model is an embedding model

> **Note**: Additional models can be used, but context length, pricing, and capability information must be added to `src/kiss/core/models/model_info.py` for accurate token tracking, budget monitoring, and test filtering.

Token counts are extracted directly from API responses, ensuring accuracy and supporting multiple agents sharing the same model instance.

### Embedding Support

The framework provides embedding generation capabilities through the `get_embedding()` method on model instances:

- **OpenAI Models**: Full embedding support via OpenAI's embeddings API
  - Default model: `text-embedding-3-small` (can be customized)
  - Usage: `model.get_embedding(text, embedding_model="text-embedding-3-small")`
- **Together AI Models**: Full embedding support via Together AI's embeddings API
  - Default model: `togethercomputer/m2-bert-80M-32k-retrieval` (can be customized)
  - Usage: `model.get_embedding(text, embedding_model="togethercomputer/m2-bert-80M-32k-retrieval")`
- **Gemini Models**: Full embedding support via Google's embedding API
  - Default model: `text-embedding-004` (can be customized; `gemini-embedding-001` also available)
  - Usage: `model.get_embedding(text, embedding_model="text-embedding-004")`
- **Anthropic Models**: Embeddings not supported (raises `NotImplementedError`)

Embeddings are primarily used by the `SimpleRAG` system (`src/kiss/agents/kiss_evolve/simple_rag.py`) for document retrieval. When using `SimpleRAG`, ensure you use an OpenAI, Together AI, or Gemini model that supports embeddings.
