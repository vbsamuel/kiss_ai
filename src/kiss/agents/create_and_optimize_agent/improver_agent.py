"""ImproverAgent - Improves existing agent code using a configurable coding agent.

The ImproverAgent takes an existing agent's source code folder and a report,
copies the folder to a new location, and uses a coding agent (Claude, Gemini,
or OpenAI Codex) to improve the code to reduce token usage and execution time.

You have to optimize an AI agent for long-running complex tasks.

## Agent Requirements

  - The agent must be designed for **long-running, complex tasks** using
    the Agent API available at {kiss_folder}.  Specifically, you should
    look at {kiss_folder}/API.md and {kiss_folder}/README.md first, and
    then look at code under the src folder as required.
    {kiss_folder}/src/kiss/core/models/model_info.py contains information
    about different LLM models and their context lengths, costs, etc.
    Use {kiss_folder}/src/kiss/agents/sorkar/assistant_agent.py
    as the initial agent implementation.
  - The agent **MUST** be tested for success on the given task description.
"""

AGENT_EVOLVER_PROMPT_PART2 = """
  - You **MUST not make the agent specific to any particular task, but
    rather make it a general purpose agent that can be used for any task**.
"""

AGENT_EVOLVER_PROMPT_PART3 = """
  - You MUST use AssistantAgent, KISSAgent, or a mixture of them
    to implement the agent.
  - You MUST not use multithreading or multiprocessing or docker manager
    or 'anyio' or 'async' or 'await' in the agent implementation.
  - You may need to use the web to search on how to write such agents
  - Do NOT create multiple variants or use evolutionary algorithms
  - Do NOT use KISSEvolver, GEPA, mutation, or crossover techniques
  - Make direct, targeted improvements to the existing code
  - Preserve the agent's core functionality - it must still work correctly
  - Do NOT use caching mechanisms that avoid re-computation

## Task Description

{task_description}

## Agent Implementation Files

Create or modify the following files in {work_dir}:

1. `agent.py` - Main agent implementation that MUST include an
   `def agent_run(task: str) -> dict[str, Any]` function.
   This function is the entry point that will be called to run the agent on a task.
   It should accept a task description string and return a result.  The result must
   be a dictionary containing the following keys:
   - "metrics": dict[str, Any] - Metrics from the agent on the task
     - "cost": float - Cost incurred by the agent
     - "tokens_used": int - Number of tokens used by the agent
     - "execution_time": float - Time taken to run the agent on the task in seconds
     - "success": int - 0 if the agent completed successfully, 1 otherwise
2. `config.py` - Agent configuration
3. `__init__.py` - Agent package initialization
4. `test_agent.py` - Tests for the agent
5. `requirements.txt` - Dependencies for the agent

The agent should collect fine-grained metrics on the task as it is executing.
When complete, provide a summary of the agent it created and evolved, and the
files that were written.

## Goals

Your goal is to improve this agent to:
1. **Reduce LLM token usage** - Minimize tokens in prompts and responses
2. **Reduce execution time** - Make the agent run faster
3. **Maintain correctness** - Ensure the agent still completes the task correctly
4. **Reduce costs** - Lower overall cost of running the agent

## Optimization Strategies to Consider

### Token Reduction
- Shorten prompts while preserving meaning
- Remove redundant instructions
- Remove unnecessary examples from prompts
- Search the web for LLM token reduction techniques

### Time Reduction
- Run short-running commands in bash
- Batch operations where possible
- Use early termination when goals are achieved
- Optimize loops and data structures
- Search the web for time reduction techniques

### Agentic Patterns
- search the web for information about various agentic patterns
- patterns that solve long-horizon tasks scalably, efficiently and accurately
- patterns that makes Python code faster
- patterns that make bash commands faster
- try some of these patterns in the agent's source code based on your needs

## Previous Improvement Report (blank if none provided)

{previous_report}

## Output Summary

When complete, provide a summary of:
- What specific changes you made
- Token savings
- Time savings
- Cost savings
- Any trade-offs or risks of the changes
