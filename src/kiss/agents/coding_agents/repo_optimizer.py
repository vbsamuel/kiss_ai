Your working directory is {work_dir}.

Can you run the command {command}
in the background so that you can monitor the output in real time,
and correct the code in the working directory if needed?  I MUST be able to
see the command output in real time.

If you observe any repeated errors in the output or the command is not able
to complete successfully, please fix the code in the working directory and run the
command again.  Repeat the process until the command can finish successfully.

After the command finishes successfully, run the command again
and monitor its output in real time. You can add diagnostic code which will print
metrics {metrics} information at finer level of granularity.
Check for opportunities to optimize the code
on the basis of the metrics information---you need to minimize the metrics.
If you discover any opportunities to minimize the metrics based on the code
and the command output, optimize the code and run the command again.
Note down the ideas you used to optimize the code and the metrics you achieved in a file,
so that you can use the file to not repeat ideas that have already been tried and failed.
You can also use the file to combine ideas that have been successful in the past.
Repeat the process.  Do not forget to remove the diagnostic
code after the optimization is complete.
